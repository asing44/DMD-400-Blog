I have wrapped up the foundation of my research for this project and am beginning to ideate on the content to be included. The resulting resarch document can be seen attached below. This ideation phase involves brainstorming different ideas for content and is the precursor to the **Content** phase which can be understood as the convergence of these brainstorming ideas generated in this **Ideation** phase and development into fully fledged assets.

## A Deep Dive into Empathy

The **Empathize** phase, started on February 8th, has been productive. In this stage, my primary goal was to fully understand the users' needs, experiences, and motivations as to prepare the main direciton for ideating content. To achieve this, I used various research methods, including user research, user personas, user journey mapping, and empathy mapping. These efforts have provided valuable insights into the potential users' desires and challenges, shaping the project's direction to ensure it meets their expectations and solves relevant problems.

## Pivoting to Ideation with Fresh Insights

Following the Empathy phase's groundwork, I've now moved into the **Ideation** phase, which is scheduled from February 13th to February 20th. This period is dedicated to brainstorming and conceptualizing creative solutions that address the insights and needs uncovered during the Empathize phase. My focus here is on generating innovative ideas for features, storytelling elements, and user engagement strategies that will make the website not only informative but also compelling and immersive.

## Looking Forward to Content Creation and Development

With the Ideation phase underway, the subsequent phases are eagerly anticipated. The **Content** creation phase, now scheduled from February 21st to March 10th, will focus on developing the actual material that will populate the website. Following this, the **Develop** phase, from February 29th to April 14th, will involve the technical realization of the website, turning ideas and content into a functional and engaging online presence.

## Engaging with New Tools and Technologies

Throughout this process, I've been excited to explore and implement new tools that streamline the creation of complex web animations. In particular, I've been utilizing **[Rive](https://rive.app/)** to bring dynamic and interactive elements to the website. This tool has significantly simplified the animation process, allowing for the creation of intricate animations that enhance storytelling and user interaction.
