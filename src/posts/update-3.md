I have wrapped up the foundation of my research for this project and am beginning to ideate on the content to be included. The resulting resarch document can be seen attached below. This **Ideation** phase involves brainstorming different ideas for content and is the precursor to the **Content** phase which can be understood as the convergence of these brainstorming ideas generated in this **Ideation** phase and development into fully fledged assets.

## A Turn To Content

The **Ideation** phase marks a turning point for the project. Research has been completed and now it is time to make use of that research by creating content. The first step of this process will involve creating a *content inventory* of what needs to be created for the site.

As of now, I am expecting to create multiple Adobe Illustrator scenes which will visualize the *SmartGarden* product and enhance the user experience. I am planning on using **[Rive](https://rive.app/)** to complete these animations.

## Generating Ideas
### Diverging
After creating a preliminary content inventory, I will then begin a series of brainstorming sessions to create several of the necessary pieces required for the **Content** creation phase of the project. These include:
- Mood board
- Storyboards
- Asset sketches

### Converging 
After finishing these separate pieces, a general review of the draft materials will occur. The selection and evaluation of the generated materials will converge ideas back toward a more focused harmony. These passed materials will collect and settle in a deliverable I am simply referring to as the *Ideation Document*.

## Project Wows and Woes
I am feeling a healthy amount of pressure to get moving toward making content for my project. I am eager to start the content creation process. Creating content is always a fun step in any project but I have learned from previous attempts with projects of this scale that it can quickly become unpleasant if the required research and planning bas not been completed. 

Knowing this, I wanted to ensure my groudwork research was sound before continuing on with the creation of content. I feel ready to make this step into creating (draft) content and am excited to share this exciting new turn for this project with you all.

## Stay Connected

As the project progresses, I remain committed to delivering a narrative website that demonstrates the power of multimedia web design and development in creating engaging online experiences. I welcome any suggestions, comments, or questions you may have. Your feedback is invaluable as it helps refine the project further.

Thank you for following along on this journey. Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to reach out via email or phone for any inquiries or discussions. Here's to creating something truly remarkable!
