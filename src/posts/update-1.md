# Project Introduction

I am currently working on a capstone project that focuses on creating a narrative website to showcase a fictional smart-home integrated gardening system.

While the smart gardening system is a crucial part of the project, it is not the primary focus. The main objective is to demonstrate my competence in multimedia web design and development. The website will not only highlight the product but also tell a compelling story about its conception, features, and potential impact.

Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my abilities in creating an immersive online experience that seamlessly integrates multimedia elements, user-friendly design, and engaging content.

# Project Timeline

Like any other web development or design project, this project is iterative. It's impossible to set a strict, linear timeline of events. However, I have a rough schedule to follow for the remaining weeks of the project:

1. üìç¬†***Define***
    
    Feb. 3rd ‚Üí Feb. 5th
    
2. **Empathize**
    
    Feb. 5th ‚Üí Feb. 7th
    
3. **Content**
    
    Feb. 8th ‚Üí Feb. 12th
    
4. **Ideation**
    
    Feb. 13th ‚Üí Feb. 17th
    
5. **Develop**
    
    Feb. 17th ‚Üí Apr. 13th
    
6. **Test and Review**
    
    Apr. 13th ‚Üí Apr. 21st

Up until now, I have:

- Finished setting up the project organization space in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
- Began the *Define* stage of my design process

*Opening page for the Define phase*

# Where Things Are At

The project is progressing well, and I am excited to continue with the plan I have laid out for the coming weeks. It's important to maintain a steady pace to avoid rushing and compromising the design quality.

I'm particularly thrilled about using a new software called [Rive](https://rive.app/) for web animation. Rive is dedicated to simplifying the process of complex web animations, which was quite tedious in the past. If you are unfamiliar with it, [here‚Äôs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-get-started-using-bodymovin-lottie-after-effects-aaron-schurman/) a helpful article that explains it well and quickly.

If you have any suggestions, comments, or questions, please reach out to me via email or phone. I'll include both at the end of these blog updates. Best of luck with your own projects!****
