# Introduction

Since the last project update, I have begun to create design wireframes for the webpage. I am starting to feel a bit of tension with the approaching deadline and have made an effort to contribtue as much time as possible toward this project. I am confident that I can still produce a professional, quality website as a result and am starting to *very much appreciate* the foundation created from previous weeks' efforts.

Here is the project timeline again:

1. ‚úÖ¬†**Define**<br>Feb. 3rd ‚Üí Feb. 7th
    
2. ‚úÖ¬†**Empathize**<br>Feb. 8th ‚Üí Feb. 12th
    
3. ‚úÖ **Ideation** <small>Previously content</small><br>Feb. 13th ‚Üí Feb. 20th<br>
    
4. üìç ***Content*** <small>Previously ideation</small><br>Feb. 21st ‚Üí Mar. 30th
    
5. üìç ***Develop***<br>Apr. 1st ‚Üí Apr. 14th
    
6. **Test and Review**<br>Apr. 15th ‚Üí Apr. 21st

Design and content creation is now in full swing along with iterative rewinds into brainstorming when necessary. I have certainly learned of the iterative nature of design and am starting to appreciate the process and its utility much, much more!

# Designing the Designs!

Here are the design tasks ahead for the remaining time I have left in this track of the project:
 - Wireframing
    - Low fidelity
 - Asset creation
   - Asset document/content document creation
 - [Style guide](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/overview/)
- Wireframing
    - High fidelity
 - Storyboarding
 - [Rive](https://rive.app/) Animations

I have intentionally created this list as a unordered one as to emphasise my previous point about the non-linearity of the design process. I am actively wireframing and planning to move onto the style guide and asset creation, but I am prepared to diverge again into wireframing or/and brainstorming too if needed at any point.

Here is the first version of my site's mobile wireframe:

And here is the newest version:

# Actual Designs!

I have started creating real design assets too. One of these is the logo for the site for which I am still brainstorming and experimenting with. Attached below is the **brainstorming**, **sketching**, and **beginning vectorization** of this asset.

<div style="display: flex; position: relative; flex-direction: row; align-items: baseline; column-gap: 20px">

## This Week's Plan

As mentioned before, I plan on continuing designing this week. My goal is to create the design style guide and content requirements document.

Once these are complete, I will be able to create a high-fidelity prototype of the website, on which all of the planned development will reference. While this is ongoing, I also need to simultaneously create the Rive animations for certain parts of the site.

This is a lot to get done in not a lot of time remaining! However, I am confident that I am capable of delivering a quality product on time as long as I move forward decisevly and continualy.


# Stay Connected

As the project progresses, I remain committed to delivering a narrative website that demonstrates the power of multimedia web design and development in creating engaging online experiences. I welcome any suggestions, comments, or questions you may have. Your feedback is invaluable as it helps refine the project further.
