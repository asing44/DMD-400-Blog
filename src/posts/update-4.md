This week I got fully involved in the **Ideation** phase of my project. I am beginning to start to appreciate the work done in previous phases, an always welcomed part of any project!

I am slightly behind schedule but am moving efficiently through the ideation phase. For reference, here is the project timeline:


# Project Timeline

Here is the project timeline again:

I am wrapping up the **Ideation** phase as of writing this post and will soon be fusing project research with ideas to produce the beginning stages of content. Below is listed the stages I have remaining in **Ideation**.

## Brainstorming

The week's work has been all about brainstorming. I have mainly been using [mind mapping](https://www.mindmapping.com/). So far, I've completed one mind map for design elements which includes:
- White space
- Layout
- Typography
- Color scheme(s)

And another mind map for total functionality of the site which includes:
- Price calculator estimate
- <span>Interactivity</span><br><small>‚Ü≥*needs more definition*</small>
- Product benefits and value
- <span>Product signup form</span><br><small>‚Ü≥*main site objective*</small>

### Remaining Brainstorming
The remaining brainstorming activities still in progress are:
- Mood board
- Sketches
  - Logo
  - Graphics
  - Rapid ideas

### Converging 
After finishing these separate pieces, a general review of the draft materials will occur. The selection and evaluation of the generated materials will converge ideas back toward a more focused harmony. These passed materials will collect and settle in a deliverable I am simply referring to as the *Ideation Document*.

## Project Wows and Woes
I am feeling a healthy amount of pressure to get moving toward making content for my project. I am eager to start the content creation process. Creating content is always a fun step in any project but I have learned from previous attempts with projects of this scale that it can quickly become unpleasant if the required research and planning bas not been completed. 

Knowing this, I wanted to ensure my groudwork research was sound before continuing on with the creation of content. I feel ready to make this step into creating (draft) content and am excited to share this exciting new turn in this project with you all.

## Stay Connected

As the project progresses, I remain committed to delivering a narrative website that demonstrates the power of multimedia web design and development in creating engaging online experiences. I welcome any suggestions, comments, or questions you may have. Your feedback is invaluable as it helps refine the project further.
