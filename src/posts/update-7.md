# Introduction

As the SmartGarden project journey continues, recent advancements have marked a pivotal transition in the project's progress. The completion of wireframes and the establishment of the color and layout style guide have laid a solid foundation for the next phase. Our recent consultation with the project advisor brought insightful decisions, notably the adoption of Tailwind CSS for the development process. Now, I am on the coding journey, eager to transform the designs into a functional reality.
